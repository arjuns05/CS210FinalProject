# CS210FinalProject
Data Management for Data Science Final Project - Arjun, Masumi, Andrew


This project explores a dataset of patient readmission data based on certain medical factors. Our notebook has code that cleans data and builds two models that can predict whether or not a patient is likely to be readmitted based on these features. We implemented it via a Jupyer Notebook and SQLite to integrate a database component.
We also integrated a Tableau feature for our dashboarding so that users can have an interactive experience to see how the data can be visualized.

A demonstration of our implementatin has been submitted for your conveneince.



The libaries are imported at the top of the notebook.

The file "final_submit.ipynb" is out final notebook containing all of our code and resulting graphs.

The data has been included as well
